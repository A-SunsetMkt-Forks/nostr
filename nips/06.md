Key derivation from mnemonic
----------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:fiatjaf`

This combines [BIP39](https://bips.xyz/39) and a modified [BIP32](https://bips.xyz/32) into a scheme that allows the generation of a private key from a list of seed words.

BIP32 is modified to use the key `Nostr seed` instead of `Bitcoin seed` in the HMAC function.

This document specifies the creation of a single Nostr private key, but it can be expanded in the future if "HD Wallets" ever become a relevant use case.

Steps for generating the private key:

1. Follow the steps on BIP39 for generating the `mnemonic` and then the `seed` (512 bytes);
2. Calculate `result = hmac-sha512(key = 'Nostr seed', data = seed)`;
3. Use the first 32 bytes of `result` as the private key.
