Basic protocol flow description
-------------------------------

`draft` `mandatory`


1. Each user has a keypair. Signatures, public key and encodings are done according to the [Schnorr signatures standard for the curve `secp256k1`](https://bips.xyz/340).
2. The single object type that exists is the `event`, which has the following format on the wire:
    ```
    {
      id: <32-bytes sha256 of the the serialized event data>
      pubkey: <32-bytes hex-encoded public key of the event creator>,
      created_at: <unix timestamp>,
      kind: <integer>,
      tags: [
        ["e", <32-bytes hex of the id of another event>, <recommended relay URL>],
        ["p", <32-bytes hex of the id of another event>, <recommended relay URL>],
        ... // other kinds of tags may be included later
      ]
      content: <arbitrary string>,
      sig: <64-bytes signature of the sha256 hash of the serialized event data, which is the same as the "id" field>,
    }
    ```
3. To obtain the `event.id`, we `sha256` the serialized event. The serialization is done over the UTF-8 JSON-serialized string (with no indentation or extra spaces) of the following structure:
    ```
    [
      0,
      <pubkey, as a hex string>,
      <created_at, as a number>,
      <kind, as a number>,
      <tags, as an array of arrays>,
      <content>, as a string
    ]
    ```
4. Users can connect to any compatible relay by opening a websocket connection to `<relay_url>/ws`. The websocket accepts the following messages:
  1. `sub-key:<pubkey, as a hex string>`, subscribes to events from this key ("follow");
  2. `unsub-key:<pubkey, as a hex string>`, as above, but unsubscribes ("unfollow");
  3. `req-feed:<{limit, offset}, object with these optional parameters>`, requests the latest events from the pubkeys subscribed to above (the basic flow is to open a websocket, call `sub-key` many times, then call `req-feed`).
  4. `req-event:<{id, limit}, object with the event id and optional parameters>`, requests one event specifically and other events related to it ("browse a thread").
  5. `req-key:<{pubkey, limit, offset}, object with the pubkey and optional parameters>`, requests one pubkey specifically ("browse a user profile").
  6. `<event, in object format as noted above>`, publishes an event.
5. There are 3 kinds of messages a user can publish (other NIPs may define different types):
  - `0`: `set_metadata`: the `content` is set to a stringified JSON object `{name: <string>, about: <string>, picture: <url, string>}` describing the user who created the event. A relay may delete past `set_metadata` events once it gets a new one for the same pubkey.
  - `1`: `text_note`: the `content` is set to the text content of a note, anything the user wants to say.
  - `2`: `recommend_server`: the `content` is set to the URL (e.g., `https://somerelay.com`) of a relay the event creator wants to recommend to its followers.
6. A relay may choose to treat different message kinds differently (for example, instead of just returning the newest events for a given profile on `req-key` it can choose to always return the latest `set_metadata` event it has even if that is very old, so the client can always see a name and picture when browsing a profile), or apply any arbitrary filtering criteria it desires to the kinds of events it will accept.
