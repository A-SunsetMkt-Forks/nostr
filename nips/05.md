Mapping usernames to DNS domains
--------------------------------

`draft` `optional` `author:fiatjaf`

On events of type `0` (`set_metadata`) one can specify the key `"domain"` with a domain name as the value. Upon seeing that, the client may use it to query a DNS server for a `TXT` record at `_nostrkey.<domain>`. If the result is a hex-encoded key equal to the pubkey of author of that `set_metadata` that means that profile can be identified to the specified domain name.

For example, if a client sees an event like this:

```json
{
  "pubkey": "b0635d6a9851d3aed0cd6c495b282167acf761729078d975fc341b22650b07b9",
  "kind": 0,
  "content": "{\"name\": \"bob\", \"domain\": \"bob.com\"}"
  ...
}
```

The client can proceed to query DNS for the `TXT` record at `_nostrkey.bob.com` and if the value is `b0635d6a9851d3aed0cd6c495b282167acf761729078d975fc341b22650b07b9` then the client can identify `b0635d6a9851d3aed0cd6c495b282167acf761729078d975fc341b22650b07b9` with the global name `bob.com` from that point on -- until it sees a new `set_metadata` event from that same pubkey without a `"domain"` key in it or until it checks the DNS again and doesn't see the pubkey there anymore.

## User Discovery

A client can also use this to allow users to search other profiles. If a client has a search box or something like that, a user may be able to type "bob.com" there and the client would recognize that it is a domain name, query DNS for the `TXT` record at `_nostrkey.bob.com` and, if a pubkey is found there, use it to search for Nostr events in whatever relays it may choose.

## Other notes

### Doing DNS queries on browsers

If a Nostr client is running on a web browser it won't have access to the low-level sockets needed for the normal DNS protocol, but luckily DNS-over-HTTPS exists now with [widespread usage and support][doh-support] and that can be used for querying. A small instructive example [exists here for inspiration][doh-example].
